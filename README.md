# wfm-hris-blueprint

This is a blueprint to demonstrate how to integrate Genesys Cloud Workforce Management (WFM) with 3rd-party Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS).

The integration allows Genesys Cloud to get employee time-off balances from HRIS and provide that information in WFM. When time-off request is created or updated in Genesys Cloud WFM, the integration submits the request to HRIS for tracking and verifying against the balance.
The integration is created and administread from within Genesys Cloud.
